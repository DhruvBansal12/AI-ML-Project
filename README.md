Used Cars Selling Price Dataset
Overview
This dataset contains information about the selling prices of used cars. It includes various attributes such as the car's make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and selling price. The dataset is designed for analysis and modeling tasks related to predicting the selling price of used cars based on their attributes.

Contents
used_cars_data.csv: CSV file containing the dataset with the following columns:
Make: The manufacturer of the car.
Model: The model name of the car.
Year: The year of manufacture of the car.
Mileage: The mileage (in kilometers or miles) of the car at the time of sale.
Fuel Type: The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., gasoline, diesel, electric).
Selling Price: The selling price of the car (target variable for prediction).
Usage
Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand the distributions, correlations, and characteristics of the variables.
Data Cleaning: Check for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data. Handle them appropriately based on the analysis.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model (e.g., create age of the car from the year).
Model Building: Use machine learning or statistical modeling techniques to build a model that predicts the selling price of used cars based on the input features.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), or R-squared.
